# Crack the Code

Crack the Code is a very simple game, your objective is to find an unknown 4 digit code
To do this you have 10 chances to input a code and from that code you get to know the amount of characters that are in the correct position (Excelent characters) and the amount that are in the number but not in the correct position (Good Characters).
The interesting part is that you only know the **amount**, you don't know which specific character is or isn't in the code. It's up to you which strategy to use.

The game is available online [here](https://tdominguez33.github.io/CrackTheCode/) to play straight from your browser.

### Details
The code is composed of 4 non-repeating non-zero digits. Because of this you can't input a number with repeated digits or zero in it.
